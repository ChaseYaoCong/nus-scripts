NUS SOC Scripts
=================

### Introduction

A collection of scripts to make the life of SOC students easier and better.

- **Claims**
  - Helpful script for any SoC undergrad tutors to submit their claims in the teaching claims portal for repetitive claims.
  - Provides tutors with a convenient way of adding weekly repetitive claims into the portal via short snippets of code, rather       than adding each claim activiy manually which is extremely tedious.
- **IVLE Photos / Know Your Classmates** (No longer functional)
  - Currently, IVLE doesn't show the photos of your classmates. 
  - This script will let you see the photos of your classmates in SoC modules.
