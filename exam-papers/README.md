NUS Exam Paper Downloader
===============
Simple script to download exam papers from the NUS database. (a little messy, though it works)
- Requires login details and module code to be inserted into the script.
- Warning: BE CAREFUL NOT TO PUSH YOUR LOGIN DETAILS. (we'll change the code to accept command-line arguments at some point)
- Works with Python 3.4
